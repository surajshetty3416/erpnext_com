### What is the GDPR?

The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a regulation in EU law on data protection and privacy for all individual citizens of the European Union (EU) and the European Economic Area (EEA). It also addresses the export of personal data outside the EU and EEA areas. The GDPR aims primarily to give control to individuals over their personal data and to simplify the regulatory environment for international business by unifying the regulation within the EU.

The GDPR lays out specific requirements for businesses and organizations who are established in Europe or who serve users in Europe. It:

- Regulates how businesses can collect, use, and store personal data
- Builds upon current documentation and reporting requirements to increase accountability
- Authorizes fines on businesses who fail to meet its requirements

### What is personal data?
Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data extends beyond a personâ€™s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.
